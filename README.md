# HTML and CSS Challange 1 

## Description: Code refactoring

This webpage was built to apply the knowledge I learned in the first week of bootcamp.

I refactored the code in HTML and CSS to make it functional, easier to read, commented changes applied to the base code.

Also, I practiced on how to use VS Code, GitHub repositories and deploy functional web page.
Now refactored code has more specific title "Horiseon", it has functional links, added alternative description for images, in case any image does not load.
Moreover, I changed none-semantic element such as ```div``` to semantic HTML elements like ```header```, ```main```, ```footer```.
I also commented on changes so refactored code is easier to read. Refactored CSS's selectors and properties look more like a simpler block of code.
